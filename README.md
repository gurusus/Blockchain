# BLOCKCHAIN
## what is a blockchain?
It is a **immutable** database.Data cant be edited or deleted,it can only be appended.
Block+Chain=BLOCKCHAIN where block = block of code and chain = pointers to those data/block.
## Types of networks
###### Centralised network
A network in which all clients make request to a *single server*.
###### Distributed network
A network in which data is stored in all the nodes of a network at a time and even if one
node fails to save the transaction an error message will be generated.
###### Decentralised network
A network in which if a data/transaction is saved in one node then it is treated as succesful one.
## Types of blockchain
###### public 
They have ledgers visible to everyone on the internet and anyone can verify and add a block of
transaction to the block chain.In this type of malicious activity can be spoteed  but the person
behind the malicious activity wont be caught.
Example- Bitcoin,Etherum.
###### private
All permissions are kept centralized to an organization.They allow only specific people in the
organization to verify and add transaction blocks but everyone in the internet is generally
allowed to view the blockchain.
Example- Multichain,Blockstack.
###### consortium
Its controlled by a consortium of members where only verified set of nodes have acces to 
the data  or block in the blockchain.
Example- Ripple,R3.
## concept of Hashes
###### Hash Functions
It converts data of any type of size to a fixed size.
###### properties of hash functions
1. Collision free - two different data sets wont have a same hash value.
2. Hiding - when data is hashed you cant find the actual data.
## Transaction flow in blockchain
1. someone requests a transaction
2. requested transaction is broadcasted to a peer-to-peer network consisting of nodes
3. the network of nodes validates the transaction and the users status using known algorithms.
4. once verified,the transaction is combined with other transactions to create a new block of data for the ledger
   which is unalterable.
